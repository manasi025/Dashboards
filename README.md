# FIFA World Cup 2022 Analysis Dashboard project
## 1. Executive Summary:
 
The project aims to develop interactive and insightful dashboards using Tableau for analyzing 
the dataset for FIFA World Cup, which took place from 20th Nov to 18th Dec 2022. The 
dashboards will focus on key performance indicators like ball possession, assists, fouls, no. of 
red or yellow cards for a particular match, goals scored by the teams, etc. using visual 
representations of bar graphs, pie charts, etc.

## 2. Problem Statement:
Background: The dataset contains information about all the matches of the Qatar 2022 FIFA 
World cup.
 
Objective: Developing dashboards to monitor and analyze key performance indicators like 
whether the match being played is a group stage match, round of 16, quarter finals, semi finals 
or finals, goals scored by each team in that particular match and whether the goal scored was 
an own goal, penalty or a free kick, etc, number of red/ yellow cards received by teams for that 
match, etc. I have also created a graph to show the maximum number of World Cups won by 
the countries.
 
Scope: Initial focus is to observe whether the team with maximum ball possession has won the 
match or not.

## 3. Data Sources:
The dataset sourced from Kaggle provides information about the 2022 FIFA World Cup held in 
Qatar from 20th Nov to 18th Dec 2022 and a few datasets from the previously held World cups. It 
provides insights like Ball possession, assists, fouls, yellow/ red cards received, penalties, own 
goals, offsides, etc. for each match and also how the number of times each country has 
participated in the event since 1930-2022. 

## 4. Methodology:
 Data Integration: Extracting and integrating the data from Kaggle into Tableau.
 
 Interactivity: Implementing interactive features for drill-down analysis and trend exploration.
 
## 5. Expected Outcomes:
 - Interactive dashboards providing real-time insights into match performance.
 
 - Enhanced decision-making through visual representation of key metrics.
 
 - Improved data accessibility and collaboration among teams.
   
## 6. Tools and Technologies:
 - Tableau for dashboard development.
 
 - Microsoft Excel for data extraction and transformation.
   
## 7. Risks and Challenges:
 - Integration challenges may arise while connecting to diverse data sources.
 
 - Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across dashboards.
 
 - User adoption and training challenges for stakeholders unfamiliar with Tableau.

# 8. Conclusion:
 This project can be used to study and analyze the Teams which played the 2022 FIFA World 
Cup. And whether having the having the maximum ball possession helps to win the match or 
not. In the end I was successfully able to conclude that the team with the most goal accuracy 
won the World Cup.
